DO NOT USE ANYTHING IT COMES WITH



DO NOT use the software 


DO NOT use the gcode on the software look at the cat file its totallllly different then what comes with cura


You have been warned use what it comes with ... ruin the crappy buildtak it comes with ... ruin all prints (look at the default nozzel size ... its .3 when it comes with .4)



.ini files are for octoprint slicer



.profile are for cura 3.2.1 (monoprice support said to use this one but really any of the as long as you dont use the gcode any of them ship with)
